# Magic Data Common

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.data.common.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.data.common)

These are the commonalities between the [magic.lambda.mysql](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.lambda.mysql) and the 
[magic.lambda.mssql](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.lambda.mssql) data adapters for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic).
They also happen to be useful if you intend to implement your own data adapter for Magic, providing base class functionality for
transforming a lambda object into a dialectic SQL statement, among other things.

This project is not particularly interesting unless you intend to create your own magic data adapter.

## License

Magic is licensed as Affero GPL. This means that you can only use it to create Open Source solutions. If this is a problem, you 
can contact at thomas@gaiasoul.com me to negotiate a proprietary license if you want to use the framework to build closed source code. 
This will allow you to use Magic in closed source projects, in addition to giving you access to Microsoft SQL Server adapters, to _"crudify"_ 
database tables in MS SQL Server. I also provide professional support for clients that buys a proprietary enabling license.
