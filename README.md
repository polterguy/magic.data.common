# Magic Data Common

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.data.common.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.data.common)

These are the commonalities for the [magic.lambda.mysql](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.lambda.mysql) and the
[magic.lambda.mssql](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.lambda.mssql) data adapters for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic).
They also happen to be useful if you intend to implement your own data adapter for Magic, providing base class functionality for
transforming a lambda object into a dialectic SQL statement, by semantically traversing a lambda object.

This project is not particularly interesting unless you intend to create your own magic data adapter.
